# CLAUDE.md

This file is intentionally short. `AGENTS.md` is the canonical source of build, lint, test, and code style guidance for this repo.

## Required Reading

- Read `AGENTS.md` before making any changes.
- Use `README.md` for architecture and project overview.
- Keep Claude-specific notes here only when they are not already covered in `AGENTS.md`.
