Bundle counts (SQLFluff): Aliasing=9, Ambiguous=9, Capitalisation=5, Convention=12, Jinja=1, Layout=15, References=6, Structure=12, TSQL=3

Status definitions:
- **Implemented (close)**: behavior is materially equivalent for common SQL patterns.
- **Implemented (partial)**: overlaps one SQLFluff rule but with narrower scope or missing configuration options.
- **Implemented (divergent semantics)**: similar category, but detects/enforces a different pattern.

FlowScope source-of-truth used for mapping:
- Rule registry: `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/mod.rs`
- Rule implementations: `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/*.rs`
- Auto-fix support (`flowscope --lint --fix`): `crates/flowscope-cli/src/fix.rs`

| Structure | `structure.constant_expression` | `ST10` | No | No | Implemented (partial) | `LINT_ST_010` | No | AST-driven core rule in `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/st_010.rs`; checks predicate expressions across SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE contexts and now aligns closer to SQLFluff ST10 by detecting equivalent-expression comparisons across `=`/`!=`/`<`/`>`/`<=`/`>=` (e.g. `x = x`, `x < x`, `'A'||'B' = 'A'||'B'`) with operator-side guardrails (defers nested comparison-expression operands) plus SQLFluff-style literal handling (`1=1`/`1=0` allow-list; non-equality literal-vs-literal deferral), including per-occurrence reporting for multiple constant predicates, while remaining narrower than full SQLFluff coverage. |
| Structure | `structure.unused_join` | `ST11` | No | No | Implemented (partial) | `LINT_ST_011` | No | AST-driven core rule in `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/st_011.rs`; now aligns closer to SQLFluff ST11 by scoping checks to explicit OUTER joins, tracking only joined relations (not base `FROM` sources), accounting for inter-join `ON` references, `DISTINCT ON (...)`, query-level `ORDER BY`, `CLUSTER BY`/`DISTRIBUTE BY`, `LATERAL VIEW`/`CONNECT BY`, and named `WINDOW` clause references, evaluating multi-root `FROM` clauses, treating qualified/unqualified wildcard projections (`alias.*` and `*`) as source references, counting references from later join relation expressions (e.g. `UNNEST(g.nested_array)`), normalizing joined-source names across quoted dialect forms (MySQL backticks, MSSQL brackets), and deferring when unqualified refs exist, while remaining narrower than full SQLFluff coverage. |
| Structure | `structure.consecutive_semicolons` | `ST12` | No | Yes | Implemented (partial) | `LINT_ST_012` | No | Dedicated core rule in `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/st_012.rs`; now uses tokenizer-level semicolon sequencing (instead of regex) to avoid string-literal/comment false positives, while remaining narrower than full SQLFluff configurability. |
| TSQL | `tsql.sp_prefix` | `TQ01` | No | No | Implemented (partial) | `LINT_TQ_001` | No | AST-driven core rule in `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/tq_001.rs`; now checks `Statement::CreateProcedure` names directly (no SQL-string regex), while remaining narrower than full SQLFluff configurability. |
| TSQL | `tsql.procedure_begin_end` | `TQ02` | No | Yes | Implemented (partial) | `LINT_TQ_002` | No | AST-driven core rule in `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/tq_002.rs`; now checks `CreateProcedure` body shape (`ConditionalStatements::BeginEnd`) instead of SQL-string regex scanning, while remaining narrower than full SQLFluff configurability. |
| TSQL | `tsql.empty_batch` | `TQ03` | No | Yes | Implemented (partial) | `LINT_TQ_003` | No | Dedicated core rule in `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/tq_003.rs`; now uses token/line-aware GO-separator detection instead of regex, while remaining narrower than full SQLFluff batch-handling semantics. |

Notes:
- `FlowScope Fix` indicates deterministic support in CLI `--fix` mode, not generic auto-fix in core linting APIs.
- `FlowScope Fix = No` marks a tracked fix gap for that SQLFluff rule mapping.
