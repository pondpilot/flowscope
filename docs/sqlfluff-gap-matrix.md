_Generated on 2026-02-12 from a local SQLFluff source snapshot (2026-01-20)._

## Summary

- SQLFluff lint rules indexed (excluding docs anchor `rule-index`): **72**
- FlowScope mapped rules: **72**
- Not implemented in FlowScope: **0**
- Implemented (close): **12**
- Implemented (partial): **60**
- Implemented (divergent semantics): **0**
- FlowScope fix coverage: **62 / 72**
- FlowScope rules without fix support: **10**

Bundle counts (SQLFluff): Aliasing=9, Ambiguous=9, Capitalisation=5, Convention=12, Jinja=1, Layout=15, References=6, Structure=12, TSQL=3

Status definitions:
- **Implemented (close)**: behavior is materially equivalent for common SQL patterns.
- **Implemented (partial)**: overlaps one SQLFluff rule but with narrower scope or missing configuration options.
- **Implemented (divergent semantics)**: similar category, but detects/enforces a different pattern.

FlowScope source-of-truth used for mapping:
- Rule registry: `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/mod.rs`
- Rule implementations: `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/*.rs`
- Auto-fix support (`flowscope --lint --fix`): `crates/flowscope-cli/src/fix.rs`

## Matrix

| Bundle | SQLFluff Rule | Code | Core | SQLFluff Fix | FlowScope Status | FlowScope Rule | FlowScope Fix | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Aliasing | `aliasing.expression` | `AL03` | Yes | No | Implemented (partial) | `LINT_AL_003` | No | Covers implicit expression aliasing; no allow_scalar configuration. |
| Aliasing | `aliasing.unique.table` | `AL04` | Yes | No | Implemented (partial) | `LINT_AL_004` | No | AST rule implemented in `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/al_004.rs`; semantics are narrower than SQLFluff for some advanced clause scopes. |
| Aliasing | `aliasing.unused` | `AL05` | Yes | Yes | Implemented (partial) | `LINT_AL_005` | Yes | AST rule in `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/al_005.rs` checks unused aliases in FROM/JOIN/derived-table contexts with SQLFluff-compatible `LATERAL`/`VALUES` exceptions; fixer removes unused aliases. |
| Aliasing | `aliasing.length` | `AL06` | Yes | No | Implemented (partial) | `LINT_AL_006` | No | AST rule implemented in `crates/flowscope-core/src/linter/rules/al_006.rs`; current behavior preserves existing max-length heuristic and still lacks SQLFluff configuration parity. |

Notes:
- `FlowScope Fix` indicates deterministic support in CLI `--fix` mode, not generic auto-fix in core linting APIs.
- `FlowScope Fix = No` marks a tracked fix gap for that SQLFluff rule mapping.
